            <p>As a primary school teacher with multiple years experience in an Inquiry based learning environment, I founded AI-Juniors to help children learn about the pros and cons of artificial intelligence in a safe, controlled environment. Our mission is to seamlessly integrate AI tools into classroom experiences, making technology both accessible and relevant for young learners.</p>
            <p>The idea came to me when I noticed a lack of integrated educational technology tools. I wanted to create something that allows children to explore AI within the context of their current studies, making the learning process more meaningful.</p>
            <p>At AI-Juniors we believe it's important for all children to experience various technology tools. For this reason we offer our services for free.</p>
            <p>Are you as excited as us? Visit our donate tab and support us to keep this page going.</p>
            <p>Reach out to us at info@reggiohome.com for any questions or support. Let's make AI learning accessible and meaningful for every child.</p>
            <p>Warm regards,</p>
